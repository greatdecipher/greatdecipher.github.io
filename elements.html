								<p>This was my first and I was a working student back then. I worked here as an Account Associate. What I do is a flexible job which is Customer service and being a Sales representative. 
									The account that I've handled was from an American Telco company.
								</p>

								<p>Here are the list of the workload that I do during my employment with VXI:</p>
								<p>-Provided excellent customer service for AT&T and establish a 
									good rapport with empathy to customer.</p>
								<p>-Experienced with troubleshooting of Data, Text and Calls 
									services and other technical support stuffs for customers to 
									minimize transfer rate.</p>
								<p>-Ability to spot fraudulent activity in customer’s account and 
									protect all sensitive information involved.</p>
								<p>-We track shipments, payments, records/notations, and claims for 
									customer’s phone services

								<p>I pursue working here at VXI because I want to experience a training ground where I can use my communication and technical skills. I am forever greatful with VXI for the things that I learn in a workplace. Also, the collegues that I had from VXI had become a family.
									Even if there is toxicity in the workload the management and leaders will always lift you up and unleash your potential. </p>
