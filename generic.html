								<p>As a student, there were a lot of challenges that I met during those times. As I keep on balancing my studies together with my responsibility as an Athlete. 
								   Smart Time Management is a factor when it comes to scheduling the subjects that I have and it should be aligned with the time of our practice.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="nuproj.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I pursue Electronics Engineering because I want to pusue a tech-related course and to learn Engineering principles. 
								   The hands on laboratory exercises during my college years helped me established projects and prototypes that has good documentation.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="studious.jpg" alt="" height="900px"/></span>
								<p>The lecture courses involves all the theories of every subject matter. Also, during the On-the-Job Training, 
									I learned that  the office is also a training ground where you need to be tough and apply what you learn during college days.</p>
